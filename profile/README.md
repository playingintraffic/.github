# Welcome to Playing In Traffic üëç

This is the new home for all public scripts and open-source projects under the **Playing In Traffic** name.  
If you knew me from BOII Development; this is the rebrand. Same dev, different direction.  
Less structure, less corporate, more weird systems and experimental builds.

# What Is This?

A dumping ground for anything worth sharing:

- Free tools for FiveM (framework-agnostic utilities, bridges, systems)
- Scripts that were too useful to keep private
- Experiments with Defold, Love2D, JavaScript game engines, and other projects outside GTA
- Anything that doesn't belong on a storefront but might still be useful

# üîì Free Projects

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`GRAFT`](https://github.com/playingintraffic/graft) | FiveM Script Dev Kit ‚Äì bridges, utils, server-side systems and much more |
| [`PLUCK`](https://github.com/playingintraffic/pluck) | FiveM UI Kit - dui, premade setups, progressbars, notifications and more |
| [`ZEN`](https://github.com/playingintraffic/zen) | A modern, modular server core designed to be extended |

More may be added, but the focus is on **quality over quantity** going forward.

# üîó Links

# ‚ùì About the Rebrand

If you're here looking for **BOII Development**, you're in the right place - just under a new name.  
Playing In Traffic is the same developer, just with a different direction:

- Less serious, more fun
- Experimental ideas first, polish later
- Support for more than just FiveM
- No interest in mass-market garbage

Everything from BOII is still supported where needed, but this is where everything new will go.

# üìû Support

All support goes through **[Discord](https://discord.gg/MUckUyS5Kq)**.  
If you post in the right place and it's not the middle of the night, I'll probably reply. If not - you'll figure it out. You made it this far.

- **Support Hours:** Mon‚ÄìFri, 10AM‚Äì10PM GMT

This isn't a community project. It's not a team.  
It's one developer laying the groundwork for something bigger - patience goes a long way.
